# Projects Max Hansen

A portfolio-style repository of engineering, physics, computer vision, and machine learning projects by **Max Hansen**.

This repo contains coursework projects, research/thesis work, and supporting materials across topics including:

* computer vision / deep learning
* optics / spectroscopy
* signal processing / EE coursework
* applied physics research

## Repository Structure

### 1) `ASL_ML_CLASSIFIER/`

ASL alphabet classification project using a ResNet-based model with webcam demo support.

**Includes:**

* training / evaluation code (`code_base/src/`)
* webcam inference demo (`webcam_demo.py`)
* test images (`asl_alphabet_test/`)
* final report PDF + demo video
* sample result images

> This project is organized as a standalone subproject with its own README and requirements file.

### 2) `Senior_Thesis_Spectrometer/`

Senior thesis project on software for a low-cost spectrometer used to analyze Ti:Sapphire laser output.

**Includes:**

* thesis PDF (`Max_Hansen_Senior_Thesis.pdf`)
* LabVIEW / KMAX spectrometer project files
* project summary README

---

### 3) `f25-final-project-main/`

Fall 2025 final project (computer vision / image matting / harmonization pipeline work).

**Includes:**

* model/pipeline code
* training and inference scripts
* evaluation notebooks/scripts
* sample inputs/outputs
* project dependencies

**Note:** Pretrained weights were intentionally excluded from this portfolio repo to keep it portable and avoid large-file/LFS issues.

---

### 4) `Research Papers/`

Collection of selected reports, papers, and writeups (coursework + research-related documents).

Examples include:

* optics / spectroscopy work
* computer vision report(s)
* physics lab/report documents
* math project paper(s)

## Quick Start by Project

### ASL ML Classifier

Go to:

* `ASL_ML_CLASSIFIER/README.md`

### Senior Thesis Spectrometer

Go to:

* `Senior_Thesis_Spectrometer/README.txt` (or convert to `README.md` later)

### Fall 2025 Final Project

Go to:

* `f25-final-project-main/f25-final-project-main/README.md`

## Notes

* This repository is organized as a **portfolio hub**, so several subfolders are independent projects with their own internal structure.
* Some large model checkpoints / pretrained weights are excluded where appropriate.
* File naming in some folders reflects original course/project exports and may be cleaned up over time.

---

## Planned Cleanup / Improvements

* Rename `f25-final-project-main/f25-final-project-main` to a cleaner project folder name
* Convert `Senior_Thesis_Spectrometer/README.txt` to `README.md`
* Add a short README to `Research Papers/` describing categories
* Standardize naming conventions across project folders
